# Snake

This repository contains code for my final project for Python Programming.
It is a simple Python app using Pygame for GUI interface and logic.

## Setup
- Follow the steps below if you want to set up the project and
run the snake game.

- In order to run the code you need to have Python 3.6+ installed.
Then you need to create and activate a virtual environment, like so:
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
- Then you can install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
  

## Run the app
- You can run the Snake game by using:
python -m main.py
- The GUI will show up, press any button and the game will start.
